          <h2>Initial Version</h2>
          <p>The initial version is the work that I sent just to give back something. It employs plain old CSS
            animations, fixed sizes, absolute positioning, ... The purpose was solely to provide something.</p>

          <h2>Abstract Version</h2>
          <p>Surprisingly, the initial version has passed. Then, I began working on the same project without any
            constraints or considerations regarding time limits or design.</p>
          <p>This was the most challenging part of the work. Specifically, it involved building up a layout for a rather
            sloppy Figma design. Here, you'll see a fully functional layout with <u>no animations</u>.</p>

        <li>
          <h2>Framer Motion</h2>
          <p>And this one is the <code>framer-motion</code> adaptation of the abstract version. The idea was to build
            upon the solid foundation established by the abstract version and then integrate any other animation library
            on top of it. Miraculously ðŸ˜œ, learning <code>framer-motion</code> and applying animations proved to be the
            easiest part of the entire process. Who would have thought? Our "brilliant" designers often rely on flashy
            animations as a crutch to mask their crappy layout designs.</p>
